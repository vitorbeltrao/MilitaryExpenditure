## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using military expenditure and country's data to better understand:

1. How much does a country's military expenditure corresponds of the respective GDP?
2. What is the per capita military expenditure?
3. What were the top ten countries with the highest war expenditures in the last year?
4. Were there extreme values in military expenditures by countries in the years there were wars?
5. What is the correlation of military expenditures with GDP and population?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 exploratory notebook available here to showcase work related to the above military expenditure questions. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://pandascouple.medium.com/military-spending-analysis-b6372831e690).
